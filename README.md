# Night Shift

You've just been assigned the night shift at the graveyard. You know what that means: fending off innumerable hordes of ghostly purple Entities. Every one you defeat just comes back the next night; tougher, angrier, and with even more friends. All you have to your name is your trusty orange jumpsuit and the gear the last guy left behind when they mysteriously disappeared. There's hardly enough time in the day to improve your gear based on what you've learned on the job, but don't spend too long! Your next Night Shift is about to start!


This is an entry to the 4th Bevy game jam. The theme was "That's a lot of entities!"
